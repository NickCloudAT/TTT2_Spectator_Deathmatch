TTT Spectator Deathmatch
========================

Spectator Deathmatch for Trouble in Terrorist Town (a Garry's Mod gamemode)

This is the Spectator Deathmatch addon that allows the spectators to fight each other instead to watch the round. To enter the deathmatch type "!dm" or "!deathmatch" or "!specdm" in the chat after you died. The living players won't be able to see or hear you and you'll be given a random primary/secondary weapon. The deathmatch lasts until the living players finished the round or until you type "!dm" again in the chat. You can also open the deathmatch statistics with "F7".

You can set everything up if you use "F1":

TTT:
You should see there a tab named "Spectator Deathmatch" which contains the loadout and some other settings.

TTT2:
You should see there a button named "Legacy Addons" and in there you will find a tab named "Spectator Deathmatch" which contains the loadout and some other settings.
You can also change the HUD under "Appearance" - "HUD Switcher" - "HUD Editor" if you don't like the HUD-Positioning.
